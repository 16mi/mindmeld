Gazetteers
==========

Gazetteers are data structures that encapsulate information about entities relevant to a domain. This includes lists and dictionaries containing names of entities such as cities, organisations, days of the week etc. The primary use of Gazetteers is to serve as a "lookup" for potential candidate entities. This provides powerful signals to your text classification and Entity Recognition models.
