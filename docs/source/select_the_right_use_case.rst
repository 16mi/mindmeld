Step 1: Select the Right Use Case
=================================

Selecting the right use case is perhaps the most important step in building a conversational application that users will love. There are many use cases where a voice or chat conversation can simplify the task of finding information or accomplishing a task. There are also many use cases where a conversational interface can be inconvenient or frustrating. Selecting an unrealistic or incorrect use case will render even the smartest voice or chat assistant dead on arrival.

While there is no magic formula to determine which use case is ideal for a conversational interface, some best practices have begun to emerge to delineate good candidates from the bad. Before selecting a use case, it is important to ask the following questions to ensure that your conversational application will be practical to build and provide real value to users.

===================================================== ===
**Does it resemble a real-world human interaction?**  Conversational interfaces do not come with instruction manuals, and there is little opportunity to teach users about the supported functionality before they take it for a spin. The best use cases mimic an existing, familiar real-world human interaction so that users intuitively know what they can ask and how the service can help. For example, a conversational interface could mimic an interaction with a bank teller, a barista or a customer support rep.

**Does it save users time?**                          Conversational interfaces shine when they save users time. A conversational interface will be viewed as an unwelcome impediment when a well-designed GUI would be faster. The most useful conversational experiences often center around a use case where users are looking to accomplish a specific task and know how to articulate it. For example, simply saying 'play my jazz music playlist in the kitchen' can be much faster than launching an app and navigating to the equivalent option by touch.

**Is it more convenient for the user?**               Voice interfaces can be particularly useful when users' hands and attention are occupied or if a mobile device is not within reach. If you expect users will often enlist your application while driving, biking, walking, exercising, cooking or sitting on the couch, it is likely an excellent candidate for a conversational interface.

**Does it hit the Goldilocks zone?**                  The best conversational applications fall squarely into the 'Goldilocks zone'. They offer a range of functionality that is narrow enough to ensure the machine learning models have high accuracy. At the same time, they have functionality that is broad enough to ensure that users find the experience useful for a wide variety of tasks. Apps that are too narrow can be trivial and useless. Apps that are too broad can have hit-or-miss accuracy which can frustrate users.

**Is it possible to get enough training data?**       Even the best use cases will fail if it is not possible or practical to collect enough training data to illustrate the complete range of envisioned functionality. For ideal use cases, training data can be easily generated from production traffic or crowdsourcing techniques. If training data for your use case can only be sourced from a small number of hard-to-find human experts, it is likely not a good candidate for a conversational interface.

For this section, we will consider a simple conversational use case which can provide information about retail store locations for your neighborhood Kwik-E-Mart. For example, you could use this service to ask about store hours: 'When does the Kwik-E-Mart on Elm street close today?'. This rudimentary use case will serve as a reference example to highlight the key steps in building a useful conversational interface.
