Introduction
============

MindMeld Workbench was build specifically to accommodate a new generation of advanced conversational assistants which need to by powered by large, dynamic custom data sets.  As a result Workbench is optimized for the following guiding principles:

    •   be adaptable to handle the diverse requirements of large applications
    •   facilitate large, custom data sets and rather than pre-trained, generic models
    •   favor power and flexibility rather than simplicity and ease-of-use
    •   favor flexible SDKs rather than hardcoded, cloud-based APIs
    •   support versatile command-line utilities rather than rigid GUIs
    •   provide robust capabilities for large on-premise or VPC production deployments

Workbench is intended to be a powerful tool for data scientists to build some of the most advanced voice and chat assistants possible today.

Talk about intended audience, prerequisites (python programming, some familiarity with ML, prior sections to read in our docs, etc.). And an outline for how rest of the user guide is structured.
