Introduction
============

MindMeld Workbench is the core machine learning toolkit that powers the MindMeld Conversational AI platform. It is a Python-based framework which encompasses all of the tools and techniques required to build highly useful and versatile conversational experiences. In addition to providing access to state-of-the-art algorithms, Workbench offers a robust pipeline for building conversational interfaces with all the necessary components like a natural language processor, a question answerer, a dialogue manager and an application manager. This allows data scientists to focus their efforts on machine learning experimentation and modeling without having to build the end-to-end plumbing and framework required to support a production quality application.

Workbench was built specifically to accommodate a new generation of advanced conversational assistants which need to be powered by large, dynamic custom data sets. As a result Workbench is optimized for the following guiding principles:

- be adaptable to handle the diverse requirements of large applications
- facilitate large, custom data sets rather than pre-trained, generic models
- favor power and flexibility over simplicity and ease-of-use
- favor flexible SDKs over hardcoded, cloud-based APIs
- support versatile command-line utilities rather than rigid GUIs
- provide robust capabilities for large on-premise or VPC production deployments

The intended audience for MindMeld Workbench are data scientists and machine learning engineers with proficiency in Python. For those new to these computer science disciplines, Coursera's Stanford courses on `Machine Learning <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>`_ and `Natural Language Processing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfoudtpBV68>`_ are excellent resources to get started with. It is also recommended that you read the :ref:`Introduction <intro>` and the :ref:`Step-by-Step Guide <quickstart>` before diving into the User Guide.
