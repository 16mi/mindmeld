Question Answerer
=================

The foundations of Question Answering began back in the 60's and early 70's with knowledge bases targeted at narrow domains of knowledge. With computational linguistics emerging and evolving over the decades, modern day Question Answering systems have relied on statistical processing of broader domain, large vocabulary document collections. These systems especially started gaining popularity in mainstream media in the last 8-10 years. The IBM Watson Jeopardy! challenge revealed the beginnings of the true potential of broad vocabulary Question Answering systems that could be deployed in real world production applications.

Several academic research initiatives continue to hallmark the field of Question Answering. The `OAQA_ <https://oaqa.github.io/>` initiative is a collaboration between `academia_ <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/>`, `industry_ <https://www.research.ibm.com/deepqa/question_answering.shtml>` and the open source community. MIT CSAIL has a research thrust in Question Answering with the `START_ <http://start.csail.mit.edu/index.php>` project. A highly regarded conference specialized to the field of Question Answering is the `TREC_ <http://trec.nist.gov/>` - Text REtrieval Conference. Several academic datasets and related publications are available there for background reading.

The MindMeld Workbench Question Answerer is specifically designed for custom knowledge bases involving large content catalogs, for production-grade applications. Catalogs containing even upto hundreds of millions of unique, domain-specific entity objects can easily be handled by MindMeld Workbench in production. Typically, Quick Service Restaurant menus range in the hundreds of thousands entities and specific product retail catalogs go into the millions, while media entertainment libraries scale into the tens or hundreds of millions of unique entities. MindMeld Workbench's Knowledge Base and Question Answering systems have been successfully been applied to all of the above use cases.

Question Answering for Conversational Applications
--------------------------------------------------

A robust Question Answering capability can sometimes be the linchpin that transforms a dumb chatbot to a highly intelligent and versatile conversational agent. As stated in the :ref:`Step By Step Guide <quickstart>`, conversational applications rely on the Question Answerer for four main purposes. We now describe each of these use cases in detail.
