Key Concepts
============

Introduce important terms with a short description and links to places in the text where the concept is described in more detail. Our audience is machine learning engineers / data scientists, so there’s no need to explain ML concepts (“training”, “k-fold cross validation”, “features”, etc.) here. The focus is instead on Workbench-specific or Conversational AI-specific terminology.
