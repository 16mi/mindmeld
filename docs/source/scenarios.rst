Your Use Case and ML/NLP
========================

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating conversational AI applications.

The MindMeld Deep-Domain Conversational AI Platform supports a wide, state-of-the-art range of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques. The platform architecture comprises components whose individual importance varies depending on your use case. Within each component, the particular ML/NLP techniques and algorithms applied vary for the same reason.

Based on your use case, you determine an approach which emphasizes appropriate components and ML/NLP techniques. The next section provides examples of this kind of decision-making. These scenarios should help you consider your own use case, spec out your own ML/NLP problem, develop your intuition about how to solve the problem, and choose the Workbench components to use in your application, along with appropriate ML/NLP techniques.

Before you build your first application with Workbench, you should:

* read through the scenarios in this chapter, using the solutions to those use case to help you formulate your own
* thoroughly study the detailed explanations in the `Guide to Deep-Domain Conversational AI`_, concentrating on the sections of the Guide that are most relevant to your use case
* continue with the Prepare Data, Build, and Deploy chapters of this tutorial
