Introducing MindMeld Workbench 
==============================

The MindMeld Conversational AI platform is one of the most advanced AI platforms available today for building production-quality conversational applications.  It was created to enable every company with the tools and techniques required to build highly useful and versatile conversational experiences. MindMeld Workbench is the core machine learning toolkit which powers the MindMeld platform. It is a Python-based framework which encompasses all of the algorithms and utilities required to build modern, production-quality conversational applications. It has evolved over several years during the process of building and deploying dozens of the most advanced conversational experiences achievable today. It has been optimized for the needs of companies that want to build an advanced conversational assistant which demonstrates deep understanding of a particular use case or domain. MindMeld Workbench is a commercial software product which requires a license to use.

The MindMeld Workbench Philosophy
---------------------------------
MindMeld Workbench is a Conversational AI platform that was specifically designed to meet the needs of enterprises that want to build and deploy production-quality conversational applications. To date, it has been used for applications in dozens of different domains by some of the largest global organizations. Over the course of these many different production deployments, MindMeld Workbench has evolved to be ideally suited for building production-quality, large-vocabulary language understanding capabilities for any custom application domain. As such, the architectural philosophy underpinning the Workbench platform has aligned around a set of guiding principles:

===============================  =====
**Power and Versatility**        Unlike GUI-based tools which are often too rigid to accommodate the functionality required by many applications, Workbench provides a collection of powerful command-line utilities which have the flexibility to accommodate nearly any product requirements.
**Algorithms and Data**          Unlike most machine learning toolkits which offer algorithms but little data, Workbench provides not only state-of-the-art algorithms, but it also streamlines the collection and management of large sets of custom training data.
**NLP plus QA and DM**           Conversational AI platforms available today typically provide natural language processing (NLP) support, but few assist with question answering (QA) or dialogue management (DM). Production applications today require all three of these components. MindMeld Workbench is designed to provide end-to-end functionality including advanced NLP as well as QA and DM.
**Knowledge-Driven Learning**    Nearly all production conversational applications rely on a comprehensive knowlege base to enhance intelligence and utility. MindMeld Workbench is the only Conversational AI platform available today which supports custom knowledge base creation. As a result, it is ideally suited for applications which must demonstrate deep understanding of a large product catalog, content library or FAQ database, for example.
**You Own Your Data**            Unlike cloud-based NLP services which require that you forfeit your data to the cloud, MindMeld Workbench was designed from the start to ensure that proprietary training data and models always remain within the control and ownership of your application.
