Step 2: Script Your Ideal Dialogue Interactions
===============================================

Once you have identified a good use case, the next step is to script your envisioned dialogue interactions. This design exercise details the conversational interaction flows which define the user experience for your application. It is important to think through not just the most obvious user flows, but also the corner case and exception user flows which may be encountered by users during an interaction. For example, the dialogue flows should illustrate how the application responds if the user request is beyond the application scope. Also, the flows should illustrate the interactions which will enable users to gracefully leave the interaction or to get help if they are stuck. The dialogue flows should detail not only the various interaction pathways a conversation may traverse, but they should also illustrate the desired language and tone envisioned for the experience.

For developers familiar with graphical interface design, this step is comparable to the task of creating wireframes and pixel-perfect mockups. Like any design step, there will likely be many iterations required to work through usability issues and reach consensus on a final design. It is always wise to begin coding and implementation only after the dust has settled on the scripted dialogue interactions. Otherwise, much implementation work and effort may be wasted. 

For our simple use case, the following diagram illustrates the dialogue interactions we will strive to deliver in our final implementation.
