Welcome to MindMeld Workbench
=============================

MindMeld Workbench

* is a set of Natural Language Processing tools for building **Deep Domain Conversational AI** systems that intelligently converse with users in natural language
* is optimized for language understanding based on **large, custom datasets** (rather than pre-trained, generic models)
* supports robust, flexible and scalable Machine Learning modeling constructs to enable **Deep-Domain language understanding**
* has been demonstrated on **production-grade** conversational apps in several domains (described below)
* enables machine learning engineers and data scientists to quickly build, test and **deploy conversational user interfaces across a wide range of platforms**

About this Tutorial
*******************

In this tutorial, you will learn

* the role of each component in the Workbench architecture
* how to train, test, and optimize each component to achieve the high accuracy required for user-facing commercial applications
* how to build an intelligent conversational interface with easy-to-use modules

In short, you will learn how to build Conversational AI applications step by step, while gaining insight into best practices.

The code samples in this tutorial draw from four applications, each featuring a medium- to large-vocabulary content catalog:

=================  =====================================================================
Application        Use Case
=================  =====================================================================
Barista            Order drinks and food at a coffee shop
Home Assistant     Operate a Smart Home, discover TV shows and movies, navigate TV Guide
Music Assistant    Discover and save favorite songs, albums, artists, playlists
Fashion Assistant  Shop for clothing and accessories
=================  =====================================================================

This tutorial assumes familiarity with `Machine Learning`_ and the Python programming language, including functional knowledge of the `scikit-learn`_ package.
