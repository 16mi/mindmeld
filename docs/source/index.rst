Getting Started
===============

1. Obtain a technology license from MindMeld

2. Install MindMeld Workbench â€” you will be prompted to enter your license key

.. code-block:: text

  pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/expectlabs/mindmeld-workbench.git

3. When writing Python code, use ``import mindmeld`` to import Workbench

.. code-block:: python

  import mindmeld as mm

.. note:: Workbench supports Python 3.5.x.

Welcome to MindMeld Workbench
=============================

MindMeld Workbench

* is a set of Natural Language Processing tools for building Deep Domain Conversational AI systems that intelligently converse with users in natural language
* is optimized for language understanding based on large, custom datasets (rather than pre-trained, generic models)
* supports robust, flexible and scalable Machine Learning modeling constructs to enable Deep-Domain language understanding
* has been demonstrated on **production-grade** conversational apps in several domains (described below)
* enables machine learning engineers and data scientists to quickly build, test and deploy conversational user interfaces across a wide range of platforms

About this Tutorial
*******************

In this tutorial, you will learn

* the role of each component in the Workbench architecture
* how to train, test, and optimize each component to achieve the high accuracy required for user-facing commercial applications
* how to build an intelligent conversational interface with easy-to-use modules

In short, you will learn how to build a Conversational AI application step by step, and gain insight into best practices along the way.

The code in this tutorial references four Conversational AI applications, each of which comes with a medium- to large-vocabulary content catalog:

* Barista (Coffee-ordering Assistant)
* Home Assistant (Smart Home, TV/Movies Discovery, Times & Dates)
* Music Assistant (Search for songs, albums, artists ...)
* Fashion Assistant (Search for clothing and fashion)

This tutorial assumes familiarity with `Machine Learning`_ and the Python programming language, including functional knowledge of the `scikit-learn`_ package.
