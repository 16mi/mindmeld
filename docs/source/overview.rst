Overview
========

Great conversational applications require both advanced technology as well as solid design judgement. The most widely used conversational applications today, such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and Cortana, are all built using a similar set of techniques and technologies to ensure both high accuracy and utility. This section outlines the methodology that is used to build today's most advanced and useful conversational applications. Specifically, this section will walk through the steps that are required to build and deploy a conversational application for a simple use case. This simple example will highlight the key design steps and technology components which underpin any great conversational experience. Along the way, we will illustrate how MindMeld Workbench can be employed to streamline the task of building and deploying conversational interfaces. 

Taking a conversational application from conception to production typically involves the eleven implementation steps summarized below.

== ===
1  Select the right use case.
2  Script your ideal dialogue interactions.
3  Define the domain, intent, entity and role hierarchy.
4  Define the dialog state handlers.
5  Create the question answerer knowledge base.
6  Generate representative training data.
7  Train the natural language processing classifiers.
8  Train the entity resolvers.
9  Implement the language parser.
10 Optimize question answering performance.
11 Deploy trained models to production.
== ===

This section will illustrate each of these steps using an example of a simple conversational application.
