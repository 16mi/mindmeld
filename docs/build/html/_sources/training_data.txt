Training Data
================

Data is the fuel that powers any machine learning-based application. Many components in our Deep Domain Conversational AI System utilize machine learned models to parse the user's query and derive meaning out of it. It's fair to say half the intelligence of the system comes from the machine learning algorithms themselves, but the other half comes from the data used to train those models.

While some of the following chapters will describe the training data required for a specific model (e.g. intent classification, entity recognition) in more detail, this chapter focuses on general best practices around working with training data.

In particular, we'll take a look at:
1. Acquiring the right kind of training data for your application
2. Annotating it appropriately to provide meaningful labels for the machine learning models to learn from
